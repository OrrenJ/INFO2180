Project 1
=========

Contains the files used to complete project 1.

This folder includes:
* _index.html_, the HTML file. The page is displayed in this file.
* _index.css_, the stylesheet used for the project.
* _2 images_ used in the project.

> All files are in one directory because ~~laziness~~ there are only a few files so arranging them in sub-directories is more work than necessary.
